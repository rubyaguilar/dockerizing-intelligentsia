# dockerizing-intelligentsia
Wanted to practice setting up Dockerfile's and did it with a Shiny App. Used @phillyo's intelligentsia product as sample App: https://github.com/phillyo/intelligentsia

1. Assuming you have a funcational Shiny App, put your Shiny App in the "app" folder and place the docker file one directory above the app directory. 
<br/>
2. Add the packages for your app in the Dockerfile
